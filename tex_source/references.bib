	abstract = {In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)], Gleis, Li, and von Delft present an algorithm for expanding the bond dimension of a Matrix Product State wave function, giving accuracy similar to 2-site DMRG, but computationally more efficient, closer to the performance of 1-site DMRG. The Controlled Bond Expansion (CBE) algorithm uses the Hamiltonian projected onto two sites, and then further projected onto the two-site tangent space, to extract a set of \$k\$ vectors that are used to expand the basis between the two sites. CBE achieves this with a complicated sequence of five singular value decompositions (SVDs), in order to project onto the 2-site tangent space and reduce the bond dimension of the tensor network such that the contraction can be done in time \$O(dwD{\textasciicircum}3)\$. In this Comment, we show that (1) the projection onto the 2-site tangent space is unnecessary, and is generally not helpful; (2) the sequence of 5 SVDs can be replaced by a single \$QR\$ decomposition (optionally with one SVD as well), making use of the randomized SVD (RSVD) with high accuracy and significantly improved efficiency, scaling as \$O(dwkD{\textasciicircum}2)\$ i.e., the most expensive operations are only quadratic in the bond dimension \$D\$ and linear in the number of expansion vectors \$k\$; (3) several statements about the variational properties of the CBE algorithm are incorrect, and the variational properties are essentially identical to existing algorithms including 2-site DMRG and single-site subspace expansion (3S); (4) a similar RSVD approach can be applied to the 3S algorithm, which leads to many advantages over CBE, especially in systems with long range interactions. We also make some comments on the benchmarking MPS algorithms, and the overall computational efficiency with respect to the accuracy of the calculation.},

	abstract = {Derivatives, mostly in the form of gradients and Hessians, are ubiquitous in machine learning. Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply "autodiff", is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names "dynamic computational graphs" and "differentiable programming". We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms "autodiff", "automatic differentiation", and "symbolic differentiation" as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

	abstract = {Derivatives play a critical role in computational statistics, examples being Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling and the training of neural networks. Automatic differentiation (AD) is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions. The implementation of AD, however, requires some care to insure efficiency. Modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, region-based memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex algorithms. For example, semi-analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and differentiate an algebraic equation. Open and practical problems include the extension of current packages to provide more specialized routines, and finding optimal methods to perform higher-order differentiation.

	abstract = {Gradient based optimization methods are the established state-of-the-art paradigm to study strongly entangled quantum systems in two dimensions with Projected Entangled Pair States. However, the key ingredient, the gradient itself, has proven challenging to calculate accurately and reliably in the case of a corner transfer matrix (CTM)-based approach. Automatic differentiation (AD), which is the best known tool for calculating the gradient, still suffers some crucial shortcomings. Some of these are known, like the problem of excessive memory usage and the divergences which may arise when differentiating a singular value decomposition (SVD). Importantly, we also find that there is a fundamental inaccuracy in the currently used backpropagation of SVD that had not been noted before. In this paper, we describe all these problems and provide them with compact and easy to implement solutions. We analyse the impact of these changes and find that the last problem -- the use of the correct gradient -- is by far the dominant one and thus should be considered a crucial patch to any AD application that makes use of an SVD for truncation.},

	abstract = {Physical interactions in quantum many-body systems are typically local: Individual constituents interact mainly with their few nearest neighbors. This locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: the entanglement entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such “area laws” for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields, in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium the current status of area laws in these fields is reviewed. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation in quantum lattice models, and disordered systems, nonequilibrium situations, and topological entanglement entropies are discussed. These questions are considered in classical and quantum systems, in their ground and thermal states, for a variety of correlation measures. A significant proportion is devoted to the clear and quantitative connection between the entanglement content of states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation. Matrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogs, and variational sets from entanglement renormalization are also discussed and the paper is concluded by highlighting the implications of area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be considered in simulations of quantum states.},

It is known that measurement and feedback (MF) can aid this task by allowing the preparation of certain paradigmatic long-range entangled states with only constant circuit depth. Here we systematically explore the structure of states that can be prepared using constant-depth local circuits and a single MF round. Using the framework of tensor networks, the preparability under MF translates to tensor symmetries. We detail the structure of matrix-product states (MPS) and projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) that can be prepared using MF, revealing the coexistence of Clifford-like properties and magic. Furthermore, we provide analytic solutions to states exhibiting MF symmetries akin to the symmetry-protected topological order in one dimension and the topological order in two dimensions, and we discuss their characteristics. Finally, we discuss the analogous implementation of operators via MF, providing a structural theorem that connects to the well-known Clifford teleportation.},

The resulting algorithm has a surprisingly close relationship to Vidal's Time Evolving Block Decimation for infinite systems, but allows much faster convergence. Access to a translationally invariant matrix product state allows the calculation of correlation functions based on the transfer matrix, which directly gives the spectrum of all correlation lengths.

	abstract = {Quantum tensor network states and more particularly projected entangled-pair states provide a natural framework for representing ground states of gapped, topologically ordered systems. The defining feature of these representations is that topological order is a consequence of the symmetry of the underlying tensors in terms of matrix product operators. In this paper, we present a systematic study of those matrix product operators, and show how this relates entanglement properties of projected entangled-pair states to the formalism of fusion tensor categories. From the matrix product operators we construct a C*-algebra and find that topological sectors can be identified with the central idempotents of this algebra. This allows us to construct projected entangled-pair states containing an arbitrary number of anyons. Properties such as topological spin, the S matrix, fusion and braiding relations can readily be extracted from the idempotents. As the matrix product operator symmetries are acting purely on the virtual level of the tensor network, the ensuing Wilson loops are not fattened when perturbing the system, and this opens up the possibility of simulating topological theories away from renormalization group fixed points. We illustrate the general formalism for the special cases of discrete gauge theories and string-net models.},

To this end, the structural tensors (or intertwiners) that arise in the usual decomposition of \$SU(2)\$-symmetric tensors are never explicitly stored throughout the simulation.

	abstract = {The dominant contribution to communication complexity in factorizing a matrix using QR with column pivoting is due to column-norm updates that are required to process pivot decisions. We use randomized sampling to approximate this process which dramatically reduces communication in column selection. We also introduce a sample update formula to reduce the cost of sampling trailing matrices. Using our column selection mechanism we observe results that are comparable in quality to those obtained from the QRCP algorithm, but with performance near unpivoted QR. We also demonstrate strong parallel scalability on shared memory multiple core systems using an implementation in Fortran with OpenMP. This work immediately extends to produce low-rank truncated approximations of large matrices. We propose a truncated QR factorization with column pivoting that avoids trailing matrix updates which are used in current implementations of level-3 BLAS QR and QRCP. Provided the truncation rank is small, avoiding trailing matrix updates reduces approximation time by nearly half. By using these techniques and employing a variation on Stewart's QLP algorithm, we develop an approximate truncated SVD that runs nearly as fast as truncated QR.},

In contrast, randomized QRCP (RQRCP) algorithms have proven themselves empirically to be highly competitive with high-performance implementations of QR in processing time, on uniprocessor and shared memory machines, and as reliable as QRCP in pivot quality. We show that RQRCP algorithms can be as reliable as QRCP with failure probabilities exponentially decaying in oversampling size. We also analyze efficiency differences among different RQRCP algorithms. More importantly, we develop distributed memory implementations of RQRCP that are significantly better than QRCP implementations in ScaLAPACK.

The algorithm combines methods from randomized numerical linear algebra in a particularly careful way in order to accelerate both pivot decisions for the input matrix and the process of decomposing the pivoted matrix into the QR form. The source of the latter acceleration is a use of randomized preconditioning and CholeskyQR. Comprehensive analysis is provided in both exact and finite-precision arithmetic to characterize the algorithm's rank-revealing properties and its numerical stability granted probabilistic assumptions of the sketching operator. An implementation of the proposed algorithm is described and made available inside the open-source RandLAPACK library, which itself relies on RandBLAS - also available in open-source format. Experiments with this implementation on an Intel Xeon Gold 6248R CPU demonstrate order-of-magnitude speedups relative to LAPACK's standard function for QRCP, and comparable performance to a specialized algorithm for unpivoted QR of tall matrices, which lacks the strong rank-revealing properties of the proposed method.},

To study localized quasiparticles of a chosen topological charge, we use pairs of degenerate ground states as boundary conditions for the iDMRG. We then show that the wave function obtained on the infinite cylinder geometry can be adapted to a torus of arbitrary modular parameter, which allows us to explicitly calculate the non-Abelian Berry connection associated with the modular T-transformation. As a result, the quantum dimensions, topological spins, quasiparticle charges, chiral central charge, and Hall viscosity of the phase can be obtained using data contained entirely in the entanglement spectrum of an infinite cylinder.},

Several of the recent advances within DMRG make it possible to perform a detailed analysis of the whole phase diagram. We consider different types of on-site anisotropies which allows us to establish the validity of the following statements: One, the spin-2 model can be tuned into a phase which is equivalent to the "topologically nontrivial" spin-1 Haldane phase. Two, the spin-2 Haldane phase at the isotropic Heisenberg point is adiabatically connected to the "trivial" large-D phase, with a continuous change of the Hamiltonian parameters. Furthermore, we study the spin-3 XXZ chain to help explain the development of the classical phase diagram. We present details on how to use the iDMRG method to map out the phase diagram and include an extensive discussion of the numerical methods.},

The review also includes results using several analytical techniques. The one- and three-band Hubbard models and the 𝑡−𝐽 model are discussed, and their behavior compared against experiments when available. The author found, among the conclusions of the review, that some experimentally observed unusual properties of the cuprates have a natural explanation through Hubbard-like models. In particular, abnormal features like the mid-infrared band of the optical conductivity 𝜎⁡(𝜔), the new states observed in the gap in photoemission experiments, the behavior of the spin correlations with doping, and the presence of phase separation in the copper oxide superconductors may be explained, at least in part, by these models. Finally, the existence of superconductivity in Hubbard-like models is analyzed. Some aspects of the recently proposed ideas to describe the cuprates as having a 𝑑𝑥2−𝑦2 superconducting condensate at low temperatures are discussed. Numerical results favor this scenario over others. It is concluded that computational techniques provide a useful, unbiased tool for studying the difficult regime where electrons are strongly interacting, and that considerable progress can be achieved by comparing numerical results against analytical predictions for the properties of these models. Future directions of the active field of computational studies of correlated electrons are briefly discussed.},

Despite unprecedented effort and tremendous progress in understanding the properties of this fundamental model, a definitive answer to whether the ground state is superconducting in the parameter regime most relevant to cuprates has proved exceedingly difficult to establish. In this work, we employ two complementary, state-of-the-art, many-body computational methods—constrained-path (CP) auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods—deploying the most recent algorithmic advances in each. Systematic and detailed comparisons between the two methods are performed. The DMRG is extremely reliable on small width cylinders, where we use it to validate the AFQMC. The AFQMC is then used to study wide systems as well as fully periodic systems, to establish that we have reached the thermodynamic limit. The ground state is found to be nonsuperconducting in the moderate to strong coupling regime in the vicinity of optimal hole doping.},

	abstract = {Tensor networks have a gauge degree of freedom on the virtual degrees of freedom that are contracted. A canonical form is a choice of fixing this degree of freedom. For matrix product states, choosing a canonical form is a powerful tool, both for theoretical and numerical purposes. On the other hand, for tensor networks in dimension two or greater there is only limited understanding of the gauge symmetry. Here we introduce a new canonical form, the minimal canonical form, which applies to projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in any dimension, and prove a corresponding fundamental theorem. Already for matrix product states this gives a new canonical form, while in higher dimensions it is the first rigorous definition of a canonical form valid for any choice of tensor. We show that two tensors have the same minimal canonical forms if and only if they are gauge equivalent up to taking limits; moreover, this is the case if and only if they give the same quantum state for any geometry. In particular, this implies that the latter problem is decidable – in contrast to the well-known undecidability for equality of PEPS on grids. We also provide rigorous algorithms for computing minimal canonical forms. To achieve this we draw on geometric invariant theory and recent progress in theoretical computer science in non-commutative group optimization.},

	abstract = {Quantum resource theories (QRTs) offer a highly versatile and powerful framework for studying different phenomena in quantum physics. From quantum entanglement to quantum computation, resource theories can be used to quantify a desirable quantum effect, develop new protocols for its detection, and identify processes that optimize its use for a given application. Particularly, QRTs have revolutionized the way we think about familiar properties of physical systems such as entanglement, elevating them from being just interesting fundamental phenomena to being useful in performing practical tasks. The basic methodology of a general QRT involves partitioning all quantum states into two groups, one consisting of free states and the other consisting of resource states. Accompanying the set of free states is a collection of free quantum operations arising from natural restrictions placed on the physical system, restrictions that force the free operations to act invariantly on the set of free states. The QRT then studies what information processing tasks become possible using the restricted operations. Despite the large degree of freedom in how one defines the free states and free operations, unexpected similarities emerge among different QRTs in terms of resource measures and resource convertibility. As a result, objects that appear quite distinct on the surface, such as entanglement and quantum reference frames, appear to have great similarity on a deeper structural level. This article reviews the general framework of a quantum resource theory, focusing on common structural features, operational tasks, and resource measures. To illustrate these concepts, an overview is provided on some of the more commonly studied QRTs in the literature.},

The finite size magnetization errors are 0.003(2) and 0.013(2) at D=16 for a system of size L=8,16, respectively. Finite D extrapolation provides exact finite size magnetization for L=8, and reduces the magnetization error to 0.005(3) for L=16, significantly improving the previous state-of-the-art results.},

By introducing the structural matrix, which codifies the details of tensor networks on any graphs in any dimension 𝑑, we are able to produce a code that can be essentially launched to simulate any lattice. We further introduce an optimized algorithm to compute simple tensor updates as well as expectation values and correlators with a mean-field-like effective environments. Though not being variational, this strategy allows to cope with PEPS of very large bond dimension (e.g., 𝐷=100) and produces remarkably accurate results in the thermodynamic limit in many situations, and specially when the correlation length is small and the connectivity of the lattice is large. We prove the validity of our approach by benchmarking the algorithm against known results for several models, i.e., the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a chain, star and cubic lattices, the hardcore Bose-Hubbard model on square lattice, the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model in a field on the pyrochlore lattice, as well as the three-state quantum Potts model in field on the kagome lattice and the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice. We further demonstrate the performance of gPEPS by studying the quantum phase transition of the 2⁢𝑑 quantum Ising model in transverse magnetic field on the square lattice, and the phase diagram of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the hyperhoneycomb lattice. Our results are in excellent agreement with previous studies.},

Motivated by the enormous successes of tensor networks for 1D and 2D systems, we develop an efficient tensor network approach based on infinite projected entangled-pair states for layered 2D systems. Starting from an anisotropic 3D infinite projected entangled-pair state ansatz, we propose a contraction scheme in which the weakly interacting layers are effectively decoupled away from the center of the layers, such that they can be efficiently contracted using 2D contraction methods while keeping the center of the layers connected in order to capture the most relevant interlayer correlations. We present benchmark data for the anisotropic 3D Heisenberg model on a cubic lattice, which shows close agreement with quantum Monte Carlo and full 3D contraction results. Finally, we study the dimer to Néel phase transition in the Shastry-Sutherland model with interlayer coupling, a frustrated spin model that is out of reach of quantum Monte Carlo due to the negative sign problem.},

By exploiting the entropic area law, the tree tensor network ansatz seems to produce quasiexact results in systems with sizes well beyond the reach of exact diagonalization techniques. We describe an algorithm to approximate the ground state of a local Hamiltonian on a 𝐿×𝐿 lattice with the topology of a torus. Accurate results are obtained for 𝐿=\{4,6,8\}, whereas approximate results are obtained for larger lattices. As an application of the approach, we analyze the scaling of the ground-state entanglement entropy at the quantum critical point of the model. We confirm the presence of a positive additive constant to the area law for half a torus. We also find a logarithmic additive correction to the entropic area law for a square block. The single copy entanglement for half a torus reveals similar corrections to the area law with a further term proportional to 1/𝐿.},

These two projected entangled simplex states are not Hermitian conjugate to each other but are appropriately arranged so that their inner product can be computed much more efficiently than in the usual prescription.

	abstract = {We introduce a randomized procedure that, given an m×n matrix A and a positive integer k, approximates A with a matrix Z of rank k. The algorithm relies on applying a structured l×m random matrix R to each column of A, where l is an integer near to, but greater than, k. The structure of R allows us to apply it to an arbitrary m×1 vector at a cost proportional to mlog(l); the resulting procedure can construct a rank-k approximation Z from the entries of A at a cost proportional to mnlog(k)+l2(m+n). We prove several bounds on the accuracy of the algorithm; one such bound guarantees that the spectral norm ‖A−Z‖ of the discrepancy between A and Z is of the same order as max\{m,n\} times the (k+1)st greatest singular value σk+1 of A, with small probability of large deviations. In contrast, the classical pivoted “QR” decomposition algorithms (such as Gram–Schmidt or Householder) require at least kmn floating-point operations in order to compute a similarly accurate rank-k approximation. In practice, the algorithm of this paper runs faster than the classical algorithms, even when k is quite small or large. Furthermore, the algorithm operates reliably independently of the structure of the matrix A, can access each column of A independently and at most twice, and parallelizes naturally. Thus, the algorithm provides an efficient, reliable means for computing several of the greatest singular values and corresponding singular vectors of A. The results are illustrated via several numerical examples.},

A detailed scaling analysis of the obtained performance as a function of matrix ranks and as a function of system size up to 12×12 lattice topology is discussed.

With this new implementation, we are able to reach an unprecedentedly large bond dimension D = 14,000 on 48 GPUs (NVIDIA A100 80 GB SXM) for an active space model (114 electrons in 73 active orbitals) of the P-cluster, which is nearly 3 times larger than the bond dimensions reported in previous DMRG calculations for the same system using only central processing units (CPUs).},

	abstract = {We present novel algorithmic solutions together with implementation details utilizing non-Abelian symmetries in order to boost the current limits of tensor network state algorithms on high performance computing infrastructure. In our in-house developed hybrid CPU-multiGPU solution scheduling is decentralized, threads are autonomous and inter-thread communications are solely limited to interactions with globally visible lock-free constructs. Our custom tailored virtual memory management ensures data is produced with high spatial locality, which together with the use of specific sequences of strided batched matrix operations translates to significantly higher overall throughput. In order to lower IO overhead, an adaptive buffering technique is used to dynamically match the level of data abstraction, at which cache repositories are built and reused, to system resources. The non-Abelian symmetry related tensor algebra based on Wigner-Eckhart theorem is fully detached from the conventional tensor network layer, thus massively parallel matrix and tensor operations can be performed without additional overheads. Altogether, we have achieved an order of magnitude increase in performance with respect to results reported in arXiv:2305.05581 in terms of computational complexity and at the same time a factor of three to six in the actual performance measured in TFLOPS. Benchmark results are presented on Hilbert space dimensions up to \$2.88{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{36\}\$ obtained via large-scale SU(2) spin adapted density matrix renormalization group simulations on selected strongly correlated molecular systems. These demonstrate the utilization of NVIDIA's highly specialized tensor cores, leading to performance around 110 TFLOPS on a single node supplied with eight NVIDIA A100 devices. In comparison to U(1) implementations with matching accuracy, our solution has an estimated effective performance of 250-500 TFLOPS.},

Although the momentum-space and quantum-chemistry versions of the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method have long been applied to such systems, the spatial topology of DMRG-based methods allows efficient optimizations to be carried out with respect to one spatial dimension only. Extending the matrix-product-state picture, we formulate a more general approach by allowing the local sites to be coupled to more than two neighboring auxiliary subspaces. Following [Y. Shi, L. Duan, and G. Vidal, Phys. Rev. A 74, 022320 (2006)], we treat a treelike network ansatz with arbitrary coordination number 𝑧, where the 𝑧=2 case corresponds to the one-dimensional (1D) scheme. For this ansatz, the long-range correlation deviates from the mean-field value polynomially with distance, in contrast to the matrix-product ansatz, which deviates exponentially. The computational cost of the tree-tensor-network method is significantly smaller than that of previous DMRG-based attempts, which renormalize several blocks into a single block. In addition, we investigate the effect of unitary transformations on the local basis states and present a method for optimizing such transformations. For the 1D interacting spinless fermion model, the optimized transformation interpolates smoothly between real space and momentum space. Calculations carried out on small quantum chemical systems support our approach.},

Progress in engineering synthetic magnetic fields5–21 has raised the hope to create these exotic states in controlled quantum systems. However, except for a recent Laughlin state of light22, preparing FQH states in engineered systems remains elusive. Here we realize a FQH state with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. The state is a lattice version of a bosonic ν = 1/2 Laughlin state4,23 with two particles on 16 sites. This minimal system already captures many hallmark features of Laughlin-type FQH states24–28: we observe a suppression of two-body interactions, we find a distinctive vortex structure in the density correlations and we measure a fractional Hall conductivity of σH/σ0 = 0.6(2) by means of the bulk response to a magnetic perturbation. Furthermore, by tuning the magnetic field, we map out the transition point between the normal and the FQH regime through a spectroscopic investigation of the many-body gap.

Tree tensor network states represent one of the simplest generalizations of matrix product states and the density matrix renormalization group. While matrix product states encode a one-dimensional entanglement structure, tree tensor network states encode a tree entanglement structure, allowing for a more flexible description of general molecules. We describe an optimal tree tensor network state algorithm for quantum chemistry. We introduce the concept of half-renormalization which greatly improves the efficiency of the calculations. Using our efficient formulation we demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of tree tensor network states versus matrix product states. We carry out benchmark calculations both on tree systems (hydrogen trees and π-conjugated dendrimers) as well as non-tree molecules (hydrogen chains, nitrogen dimer, and chromium dimer). In general, tree tensor network states require much fewer renormalized states to achieve the same accuracy as matrix product states. In non-tree molecules, whether this translates into a computational savings is system dependent, due to the higher prefactor and computational scaling associated with tree algorithms. In tree like molecules, tree network states are easily superior to matrix product states. As an illustration, our largest dendrimer calculation with tree tensor network states correlates 110 electrons in 110 active orbitals.},

While MPSs can efficiently find ground states of one-dimensional systems, their capacities are limited when simulating their dynamics, where the entanglement can increase ballistically with time. On the other hand, quantum devices appear as a natural platform to encode and perform the time evolution of correlated many-body states. However, accessing the regime of long-time dynamics is hampered by quantum noise. In this paper we use the best of worlds: the short-time dynamics is efficiently performed by MPSs, compiled into short-depth quantum circuits, and performed further in time on a quantum computer thanks to efficient MPO-optimized quantum circuits. We quantify the capacities of this hybrid classical-quantum scheme in terms of fidelities taking into account a noise model. We show that using classical knowledge in the form of tensor networks provides a way to better use limited quantum resources and lowers the noise requirements to reach a practical quantum advantage. Finally, we successfully demonstrate our approach with an experimental realization of the technique. Combined with efficient circuit transpilation we simulate a ten-qubit system on an actual quantum device over a longer time scale than low-bond-dimension MPSs and purely quantum Trotter evolution.},

The emergence of exascale high-performance computing (HPC) platforms presents new opportunities for pushing the boundaries of quantum circuit simulation. We present a modernized version of the Tensor Network Quantum Virtual Machine (TNQVM) that serves as the quantum circuit simulation backend in the eXtreme-scale ACCelerator (XACC) framework. The new version is based on the scalable tensor network processing library ExaTN (Exascale Tensor Networks). It provides multiple configurable quantum circuit simulators that perform either an exact quantum circuit simulation via the full tensor network contraction or an approximate simulation via a suitably chosen tensor factorization scheme. Upon necessity, stochastic noise modeling from real quantum processors is incorporated into the simulations by modeling quantum channels with Kraus tensors. By combining the portable XACC quantum programming frontend and the scalable ExaTN numerical processing backend, we introduce an end-to-end virtual quantum development environment that can scale from laptops to future exascale platforms.

	abstract = {The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) realized in two-dimensional electron systems under a magnetic field is one of the most remarkable discoveries in condensed matter physics. Interestingly, it has been proposed that FQHE can also emerge in time-reversal invariant spin systems, known as the chiral spin liquid (CSL) characterized by the topological order and the emerging of the fractionalized quasiparticles. A CSL can naturally lead to the exotic superconductivity originating from the condense of anyonic quasiparticles. Although CSL was highly sought after for more than twenty years, it had never been found in a spin isotropic Heisenberg model or related materials. By developing a density-matrix renormalization group based method for adiabatically inserting flux, we discover a FQHE in a isotropic kagome Heisenberg model. We identify this FQHE state as the long-sought CSL with a uniform chiral order spontaneously breaking time reversal symmetry, which is uniquely characterized by the half-integer quantized topological Chern number protected by a robust excitation gap. The CSL is found to be at the neighbor of the previously identified Z2 spin liquid, which may lead to an exotic quantum phase transition between two gapped topological spin liquids.},

	abstract = {The so-called minimal models of unconventional superconductivity are lattice models of interacting electrons derived from materials in which electron pairing arises from purely repulsive interactions. Showing unambiguously that a minimal model actually can have a superconducting ground state remains a challenge at nonperturbative interactions. We make a significant step in this direction by computing ground states of the 2D U-V Hubbard model—the minimal model of the quasi-1D superconductors—by parallelized DMRG, which allows for systematic control of any bias and that is sign-problem-free. Using distributed-memory supercomputers and leveraging the advantages of the U-V model, we can treat unprecedented sizes of 2D strips and extrapolate their spin gap both to zero approximation error and the thermodynamic limit. Our results for the spin gap are shown to be compatible with a spin excitation spectrum that is either fully gapped or has zeros only in discrete points, and conversely that a Fermi liquid or magnetically ordered ground state is incompatible with them. Coupled with the enhancement to short-range correlations that we find exclusively in the 𝑑𝑥⁢𝑦 pairing channel, this allows us to build an indirect case for the ground state of this model having superconducting order in the full 2D limit, and ruling out the other main possible phases, magnetic orders, and Fermi liquids.},

Standard algorithms for one-dimensional systems construct model states with limited entanglement, which are a worse approximation to quantum critical states than to others. We give a quantitative theory of previously observed scaling behavior resulting from finite entanglement at quantum criticality. Finite-entanglement scaling in one-dimensional systems is governed not by the scaling dimension of an operator but by the "central charge" of the critical point. An important ingredient is the universal distribution of density-matrix eigenvalues at a critical point [P. Calabrese and A. Lefevre, Phys. Rev. A 78, 032329 (2008)]. The parameter-free theory is checked against numerical scaling at several quantum critical points.},

In particular, we show that the computational cost for fixed bond dimension of the hybrid-space DMRG is approximately independent of the width of the lattice, in contrast to the real-space DMRG, for which it is proportional to the width squared. We apply the hybrid-space algorithm to calculate the ground state of the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model on cylinders of width four and six sites; at 𝑛=0.875 filling, the ground state exhibits a striped charge-density distribution with a wavelength of eight sites for both 𝑈/𝑡=4.0 and 8.0.

	abstract = {A general framework for non-abelian symmetries is presented for matrix-product and tensor-network states in the presence of well-defined orthonormal local as well as effective basis sets. The two crucial ingredients, the Clebsch–Gordan algebra for multiplet spaces as well as the Wigner–Eckart theorem for operators, are accounted for in a natural, well-organized, and computationally straightforward way. The unifying tensor-representation for quantum symmetry spaces, dubbed QSpace, is particularly suitable to deal with standard renormalization group algorithms such as the numerical renormalization group (NRG), the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), or also more general tensor networks such as the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). In this paper, the focus is on the application of the non-abelian framework within the NRG. A detailed analysis is presented for a fully screened spin- 3/2 three-channel Anderson impurity model in the presence of conservation of total spin, particle–hole symmetry, and SU(3) channel symmetry. The same system is analyzed using several alternative symmetry scenarios based on combinations of U(1)charge, SU(2)spin, SU(2)charge, SU(3)channel, as well as the enveloping symplectic Sp(6) symmetry. These are compared in detail, including their respective dramatic gain in numerical efficiency. In the Appendix A Non-abelian symmetries 101, Appendix B Numerical implementation, Appendix C Example, finally, an extensive introduction to non-abelian symmetries is given for practical applications, together with simple self-contained numerical procedures to obtain Clebsch–Gordan coefficients and irreducible operators sets. The resulting QSpace tensors can deal with any set of abelian symmetries together with arbitrary non-abelian symmetries with compact, i.e. finite-dimensional, semi-simple Lie algebras.},

	abstract = {The benefits of exploiting the presence of symmetries in tensor network algorithms have been extensively demonstrated in the context of matrix product states (MPSs). These include the ability to select a specific symmetry sector (e.g., with a given particle number or spin), to ensure the exact preservation of total charge, and to significantly reduce computational costs. Compared to the case of a generic tensor network, the practical implementation of symmetries in the MPS is simplified by the fact that tensors only have three indices (they are trivalent, just as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the symmetry group) and are organized as a one-dimensional array of tensors, without closed loops. Instead, a more complex tensor network, one where tensors have a larger number of indices and/or a more elaborate network structure, requires a more general treatment. In two recent papers, namely, (i) [Singh, Pfeifer, and Vidal, Phys. Rev. A 82, 050301 (2010)] and (ii) [Singh, Pfeifer, and Vidal, Phys. Rev. B 83, 115125 (2011)], we described how to incorporate a global internal symmetry into a generic tensor network algorithm based on decomposing and manipulating tensors that are invariant under the symmetry. In (i) we considered a generic symmetry group 𝒢 that is compact, completely reducible, and multiplicity free, acting as a global internal symmetry. Then, in (ii) we described the implementation of Abelian group symmetries in much more detail, considering a U(1) symmetry (e.g., conservation of global particle number) as a concrete example. In this paper, we describe the implementation of non-Abelian group symmetries in great detail. For concreteness, we consider an SU(2) symmetry (e.g., conservation of global quantum spin). Our formalism can be readily extended to more exotic symmetries associated with conservation of total fermionic or anyonic charge. As a practical demonstration, we describe the SU(2)-invariant version of the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz and apply it to study the low-energy spectrum of a quantum spin chain with a global SU(2) symmetry.},

We develop a complete theory of the ergodic decomposition of such states, including the decomposition into periodic “Néel ordered” states. The ergodic components have exponential decay of correlations. All states considered can be obtained as “local functions” of states of a special kind, so-called “purely generated states,” which are shown to be ground states for suitably chosen finite range VBS interactions. We show that all these generalized VBS models have a spectral gap. Our theory does not require symmetry of the state with respect to a local gauge group.

This approach is much more accurate than the standard approach; for example, energies for the S=1 Heisenberg chain can be obtained to an accuracy of at least 10−9.

	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevB.105.174205},
	abstract = {We numerically study both the avalanche instability and many-body resonances in strongly disordered spin chains exhibiting many-body localization (MBL). Finite-size systems behave like MBL within the MBL regimes, which we divide into the asymptotic MBL phase and the finite-size MBL regime; the latter regime is, however, thermal in the limit of large systems and long times. In both Floquet and Hamiltonian models, we identify some landmarks within the MBL regimes. Our first landmark is an estimate of where the MBL phase becomes unstable to avalanches, obtained by measuring the slowest relaxation rate of a finite chain coupled to an infinite bath at one end. Our estimates indicate that the actual MBL-to-thermal phase transition occurs much deeper in the MBL regimes than has been suggested by most previous studies. Our other landmarks involve systemwide many-body resonances: We find that the effective matrix elements producing eigenstates with systemwide many-body resonances are enormously broadly distributed. This broad distribution means that the onset of such resonances in typical samples occurs quite deep in the MBL regimes, and the first such resonances typically involve rare pairs of eigenstates that are farther apart in energy than the minimum gap. Thus we find that the resonance properties define two landmarks that divide the MBL regimes of finite-size systems into three subregimes: (i) at strongest randomness, typical samples do not have any eigenstates that are involved in systemwide many-body resonances; (ii) there is a substantial intermediate subregime where typical samples do have such resonances but the pair of eigenstates with the minimum spectral gap does not, so the size of the minimum gap agrees with expectations from Poisson statistics; and (iii) in the weaker randomness subregime, the minimum gap is larger than predicted by Poisson level statistics because it is involved in a many-body resonance and thus subject to level repulsion. Nevertheless, even in this third subregime, all but a vanishing fraction of eigenstates remain nonresonant and the system thus still appears MBL in most respects. Based on our estimates of the location of the avalanche instability, it might be that the MBL phase is only part of subregime (i) and the other subregimes are entirely in the thermal phase, even though they look localized in most respects, so are in the finite-size MBL regime.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2404.19023},
	abstract = {We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.},

As in the bosonic case, the cost of simulations depends on the amount of entanglement in the ground state and not directly on the strength of interactions. The present formulation of fermionic PEPS leads to a straightforward numerical implementation that allowed us to recycle much of the code for bosonic PEPS. We demonstrate that fermionic PEPS are a useful variational ansatz for interacting fermion systems by computing approximations to the ground state of several models on an infinite lattice. For a model of interacting spinless fermions, ground state energies lower than Hartree-Fock results are obtained, shifting the boundary between the metal and charge-density wave phases. For the 𝑡−𝐽 model, energies comparable with those of a specialized Gutzwiller-projected ansatz are also obtained.},

Despite its many successful implementations, the method has some limitations in its present formulation which hinder its application to some highly entangled systems. The purpose of this paper is to unravel some of these issues, in turn enhancing the stability and efficiency of iPEPS methods. For this, we first introduce the fast full update scheme, where effective environment and iPEPS tensors are both simultaneously updated (or evolved) throughout time. As we shall show, this implies two crucial advantages: (i) dramatic computational savings and (ii) improved overall stability. In addition, we extend the application of the local gauge fixing, successfully implemented for finite-size PEPS [M. Lubasch et al., Phys. Rev. B 90, 064425 (2014)], to the iPEPS algorithm. We see that the gauge fixing not only further improves the stability of the method but also accelerates the convergence of the alternating least-squares sweeping in the (either “full” or “fast full”) tensor update scheme. The improvement in terms of computational cost and stability of the resulting “improved” iPEPS algorithm is benchmarked by studying the ground-state properties of the quantum Heisenberg and transverse-field Ising models on an infinite square lattice.},

	abstract = {Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) methods have been proven to be powerful tools to solve strongly correlated quantum many-body problems in two dimensions. However, due to the high computational scaling with the virtual bond dimension 𝐷, in a practical application, PEPS are often limited to rather small bond dimensions, which may not be large enough for some highly entangled systems, for instance, frustrated systems. Optimization of the ground state using the imaginary time evolution method with a simple update scheme may go to a larger bond dimension. However, the accuracy of the rough approximation to the environment of the local tensors is questionable. Here, we demonstrate that by combining the imaginary time evolution method with a simple update, Monte Carlo sampling techniques and gradient optimization will offer an efficient method to calculate the PEPS ground state. By taking advantage of massive parallel computing, we can study quantum systems with larger bond dimensions up to 𝐷=10 without resorting to any symmetry. Benchmark tests of the method on the 𝐽1−𝐽2 model give impressive accuracy compared with exact results.},

We propose a sampling algorithm that generates independent samples from a PEPS, bypassing all problems related to finite autocorrelation times. This algorithm is a generalization of an existing direct sampling algorithm for unitary tensor networks. We introduce an auxiliary probability distribution from which independent samples can be drawn, and combine it with importance sampling in order to evaluate expectation values accurately.

We present essential techniques to differentiate through the tensor networks contraction algorithms, including numerical stable differentiation for tensor decompositions and efficient backpropagation through fixed-point iterations. As a demonstration, we compute the specific heat of the Ising model directly by taking the second-order derivative of the free energy obtained in the tensor renormalization group calculation. Next, we perform gradient-based variational optimization of infinite projected entangled pair states for the quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and obtain state-of-the-art variational energy and magnetization with moderate efforts.

For the transverse Ising model on the square lattice, we determine the Binder cumulant of the classical counterpart for a range of aspect ratios between the system sizes in the third or “classical” direction and that in the other two directions.

Over a wide range on both sides of the quantum phase transition (QPT) from the dimer-product state to the plaquette-based ground state, neither analytical nor any available numerical methods have come close to reproducing the physics of the excited states and thermal response. We solve this problem in the dimer-product phase by introducing two qualitative advances in computational physics. One is the use of thermal pure quantum (TPQ) states to augment dramatically the size of clusters amenable to exact diagonalization. The second is the use of tensor-network methods, in the form of infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS), for the calculation of finite-temperature quantities. We demonstrate convergence as a function of system size in TPQ calculations and of bond dimension in our iPEPS results, with complete mutual agreement even extremely close to the QPT. Our methods reveal a remarkably sharp and low-lying feature in the magnetic specific heat, whose origin appears to lie in a proliferation of excitations composed of two-triplon bound states. The surprisingly low energy scale and apparently extended spatial nature of these states explain the failure of less refined numerical approaches to capture their physics. Both of our methods will have broad and immediate application in addressing the thermodynamic response of a wide range of highly frustrated magnetic models and materials.},

The first approach is based on a contraction of a finite cluster of tensors including an effective environment to approximate the full 3D network. The second approach performs a full contraction of the network by first iteratively contracting layers of the network with a boundary iPEPS, followed by a contraction of the resulting quasi-2D network using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group.

We show that the lowest levels of this hierarchy exhibit a very rich structure including states with critical and topological properties. We prove, in particular, that coherent versions of thermal states of any local 2⁢𝐷 classical spin model correspond to such PEPS, which are in turn ground states of local 2⁢𝐷 quantum Hamiltonians. This correspondence maps thermal onto quantum fluctuations, and it allows us to analytically construct critical quantum models exhibiting a strict area law scaling of the entanglement entropy in the face of power law decaying correlations. Moreover, it enables us to show that there exist PEPS which can serve as computational resources for the solution of 𝑁⁢𝑃-hard problems.},

This concept emerges from deep learning, and has also been generalized to tensor network optimizations. Here, we extend the differentiable programming to tensor networks with isometric constraints with applications to multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and tensor network renormalization (TNR). By introducing several gradient-based optimization methods for the isometric tensor network and comparing with Evenbly–Vidal method, we show that auto-differentiation has a better performance for both stability and accuracy. We numerically tested our methods on 1D critical quantum Ising spin chain and 2D classical Ising model. We calculate the ground state energy for the 1D quantum model and internal energy for the classical model, and scaling dimensions of scaling operators and find they all agree with the theory well.},

	abstract = {Matrix product states and matrix product operators (MPOs) are one-dimensional tensor networks that underlie the modern density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. The use of MPOs accounts for the high level of generality and wide range of applicability of DMRG. However, current algorithms for two-dimensional (2D) tensor network states, known as projected entangled-pair states, rarely employ the associated 2D tensor network operators, projected entangled-pair operators (PEPOs), due to their computational cost and conceptual complexity. To lower these two barriers, we describe how to reformulate a PEPO into a set of tensor network operators that resemble MPOs by considering the different sets of local operators that are generated from sequential bipartitions of the 2D system. The expectation value of a PEPO can then be evaluated on the fly using only the action of MPOs and generalized MPOs at each step of the approximate contraction of the 2D tensor network. This technique allows for the simpler construction and more efficient energy evaluation of 2D Hamiltonians that contain finite-range interactions, and provides an improved strategy to encode long-range interactions that is orders of magnitude more accurate and efficient than existing schemes.},

An exact contraction is in general impossible, and the choice of the approximating procedure determines the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm. We analyze different previous proposals for this approximation, and show that they can be understood via the form of their environment, i.e. the operator that results from contracting part of the network. This provides physical insight into the limitation of various approaches, and allows us to introduce a new strategy, based on the idea of clusters, that unifies previous methods. The resulting contraction algorithm interpolates naturally between the cheapest and most imprecise and the most costly and most precise method. We benchmark the different algorithms with finite PEPS, and show how the cluster strategy can be used for both the tensor optimization and the calculation of expectation values. Additionally, we discuss its applicability to the parallelization of PEPS and to infinite systems.},

We discuss how the resulting algorithm resembles the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for finding ground states so closely that it can be implemented by changing just a few lines of code and it inherits the same stability and efficiency. In particular, our method is compatible with any Hamiltonian for which ground-state DMRG can be implemented efficiently.

Potential applications of the TEBD algorithm are the simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians, transport in quantum systems far from equilibrium and dissipative quantum mechanics. In this paper we translate the TEBD algorithm into the language of matrix product states in order to both highlight and exploit its resemblances to the widely used density-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) algorithms. The TEBD algorithm, being based on updating a matrix product state in time, is very accessible to the DMRG community and it can be enhanced by using well-known DMRG techniques, for instance in the event of good quantum numbers. More importantly, we show how it can be simply incorporated into existing DMRG implementations to produce a remarkably effective and versatile ‘adaptive time-dependent DMRG’ variant, that we also test and compare to previous proposals.},

	abstract = {Order parameters are key to our understanding of phases of matter. Not only do they allow one to classify phases, but they also enable the study of phase transitions through their critical exponents which identify the universal long-range physics underlying the transition. Topological phases are exotic quantum phases which are lacking the characterization in terms of order parameters. While probes have been developed to identify such phases, those probes are only qualitative, in that they take discrete values, and, thus, provide no means to study the scaling behavior in the vicinity of phase transitions. In this paper, we develop a unified framework based on variational tensor networks (infinite projected entangled pair states) for the quantitative study of both topological and conventional phase transitions through entanglement order parameters. To this end, we employ tensor networks with suitable physical and/or entanglement symmetries encoded and allow for order parameters detecting the behavior of any of those symmetries, both physical and entanglement ones. On the one hand, this gives rise to entanglement-based order parameters for topologically ordered phases. These topological order parameters allow one to quantitatively probe the behavior when going through topological phase transitions and, thus, to identify universal signatures of such transitions. We apply our framework to the study of the toric code model in different magnetic fields, which along some special lines maps to the (2+1)⁢D Ising model. Our method identifies 3D Ising critical exponents for the entire transition, consistent with those special cases and general belief. However, we, in addition, also find an unknown critical exponent 𝛽*≈0.021 for one of our topological order parameters. We take this—together with known dualities between the toric code and the Ising model—as a motivation to also apply our framework of entanglement order parameters to conventional phase transitions. There, it enables us to construct a novel type of disorder operator (or disorder parameter), which is nonzero in the disordered phase and measures the response of the wave function to a symmetry twist in the entanglement. We numerically evaluate this disorder operator for the (2+1)⁢D transverse field Ising model, where we again recover a critical exponent hitherto unknown in the (2+1)⁢D Ising model, 𝛽*≈0.024, consistent with the findings for the toric code. This shows that entanglement order parameters can provide additional means of characterizing the universal data both at topological and conventional phase transitions and altogether demonstrates the power of this framework to identify the universal data underlying the transition.},

	abstract = {Abelian and non-Abelian topological phases exhibiting protected chiral edge modes are ubiquitous in the realm of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect. Here, we investigate a spin-1 Hamiltonian on the square lattice which could, potentially, host the spin liquid analog of the (bosonic) non-Abelian Moore-Read FQH state, as suggested by exact diagonalization of small clusters. Using families of fully SU(2)-spin symmetric and translationally invariant chiral projected entangled pair states (PEPS), variational energy optimization is performed using infinite-PEPS methods, providing good agreement with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) results. A careful analysis of the bulk spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlation functions in the optimized spin liquid suggests that they exhibit long-range “gossamer tails”. From the investigation of the entanglement spectrum, we observe sharply defined chiral edge modes following the prediction of the SU(2)2 Wess-Zumino-Witten theory and exhibiting a conformal field theory (CFT) central charge 𝑐=3/2, as expected for a Moore-Read chiral spin liquid. Using the PEPS bulk-edge correspondence, we argue the “weak” criticality of the bulk is in fact a finite-𝐷 artifact of the chiral PEPS, which quickly becomes (practically) irrelevant as the PEPS bond dimension 𝐷 is increased. We conclude that the PEPS formalism offers an unbiased and efficient method to investigate non-Abelian chiral spin liquids in quantum antiferromagnets.},

Its real, Lindbladian, or imaginary time evolution can be split into small time steps. Every time step generates a new iPEPS with an enlarged bond dimension 𝐷′{\textgreater}𝐷, which is approximated by an iPEPS with the original 𝐷. In P. Czarnik and J. Dziarmaga, Phys. Rev. B 98, 045110 (2018), an algorithm was introduced to optimize the approximate iPEPS by maximizing directly its fidelity to the one with the enlarged bond dimension 𝐷′. In this paper, we implement a more efficient optimization employing a local estimator of the fidelity. For imaginary time evolution of a thermal state's purification, we also consider using unitary disentangling gates acting on ancillas to reduce the required 𝐷. We test the algorithm simulating Lindbladian evolution and unitary evolution after a sudden quench of transverse field ℎ𝑥 in the 2D quantum Ising model. Furthermore, we simulate thermal states of this model and estimate the critical temperature with good accuracy: 0.1\% for ℎ𝑥=2.5 and 0.5\% for the more challenging case of ℎ𝑥=2.9 close to the quantum critical point at ℎ𝑥=3.04438⁢(2).},

The absence of thermalization behavior manifests itself, for example, in a remanence of local particle number configurations, a quantity that is robust over a parameter range. Local particle numbers are directly accessible in programmable quantum simulators, in systems of cold atoms, even in two spatial dimensions. Yet, the classical simulation aimed at building trust in quantum simulations is highly challenging. In this work, we present a comprehensive tensor network simulation of a many-body localized systems in two spatial dimensions using a variant of an infinite projected entangled pair states algorithm. The required translational invariance can be restored by implementing the disorder into an auxiliary spin system, providing an exact disorder average under dynamics. We can quantitatively assess signatures of many-body localization for the infinite system: Our methods are powerful enough to provide crude dynamical estimates for the transition between localized and ergodic phases. Interestingly, in this setting of finitely many disorder values, which we also compare with simulations involving noninteracting fermions and for which we discuss the emergent physics, localization emerges in the interacting regime, for which we provide an intuitive argument, while Anderson localization is absent.},

In this paper we test an intermediate neighborhood tensor update (NTU) accounting for the nearest-neighbor environment. This small environment can be contracted exactly in a parallelizable way. It provides an error measure that is Hermitian and non-negative down to machine precision. In the two-dimensional quantum Ising model, NTU is shown to yield stable unitary time evolution following a sudden quench. It also yields accurate thermal states despite correlation lengths that reach up to 20 lattice sites. The latter simulations were performed with a manifestly Hermitian purification of a thermal state. Both were performed with reduced tensors that do not include physical (and ancilla) indices. This modification naturally leads to two other schemes: a local SVD update and a full tensor update being a variant of FU.},

In this work, we provide an exact duality mapping between the bulk of a quantum spin system and its boundary using projected entangled-pair states. This duality associates to every region a Hamiltonian on its boundary, in such a way that the entanglement spectrum of the bulk corresponds to the excitation spectrum of the boundary Hamiltonian. We study various specific models: a deformed AKLT model [I. Affleck, T. Kennedy, E. H. Lieb, and H. Tasaki, Phys. Rev. Lett. 59, 799 (1987)], an Ising-type model [F. Verstraete, M. M. Wolf, D.

In the second case, some of those models display quantum phase transitions. We find that a gapped bulk phase with local order corresponds to a boundary Hamiltonian with local interactions, whereas critical behavior in the bulk is reflected on a diverging interaction length of the boundary Hamiltonian. Furthermore, topologically ordered states yield nonlocal Hamiltonians. Because our duality also associates a boundary operator to any operator in the bulk, it in fact provides a full holographic framework for the study of quantum many-body systems via their boundary.},

	abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) has established itself over the last decade as the leading method for the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme is then demonstrated, capable of either finding the ground-state or describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. We show that this approach achieves very high accuracy in the description of equilibrium and dynamical properties of prototypical interacting spins models in both one and two dimensions, thus offering a new powerful tool to solve the quantum many-body problem.},

In the first regime, MPS can be used to perform finite size scaling (FSS). In the complementary regime, the MPS simulations show instead the clear signature of finite entanglement scaling (FES). In the thermodynamic limit (or large 𝑁 limit), only MPS in the FSS regime maintain a finite overlap with the exact ground state. This observation has implications on how to correctly perform FSS with MPS as well as on the performance of recent MPS algorithms for systems with PBC.

The method is a generalization of Handscomb’s method but applicable to any length of the spin, i.e., when the spin traces cannot be evaluated analytically. The Monte Carlo sampling is extended to the space of spin vectors in addition to the usual operator-index sequences. An important technical point is that the index sequences are augmented with the aid of unit operators to a constant, self-consistently determined length. The scheme is applied to the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin-S Heisenberg model. Results at low temperatures are reported for S=1 and S=3/2 and system sizes up to N=64. The computed magnetic structure factor in the S=1 chain is in agreement with earlier ground-state calculations. For S=3/2 we find the exponent γ¯=0.49±0.04 for the divergence of the antiferromagnetic structure factor. Further, the susceptibility as a function of the wave number is computed. For S=1 the staggered susceptibility χ(π) at T=0 is found to take the value 20.0±1.5 in units such that χ(q)→𝑇−1 at high temperatures (with the temperature scale defined by 𝑘𝐵=1).

The solution relies on the identification of operator loops which change the configuration sign when updated (“merons”) and is similar to the meron-cluster algorithm recently proposed by Chandrasekharan and Wiese for solving the sign problem for a class of fermion models [Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 3116 (1999)]. Some important expectation values, e.g., the internal energy, can be evaluated in the subspace with no merons, where the weight function is positive definite. Calculations of other expectation values require sampling of configurations with only a small number of merons (typically zero or two), with an accompanying sign problem which is not serious. We also discuss problems which arise in applying the meron concept to more general quantum spin models with frustrated interactions.},

The time evolution of simple (unentangled) initial states is studied numerically for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension described by the random-field 𝑋⁢𝑋⁢𝑍 Hamiltonian. Interactions induce a dramatic change in the propagation of entanglement and a smaller change in the propagation of particles. For even weak interactions, when the system is thought to be in a many-body localized phase, entanglement shows neither localized nor diffusive behavior but grows without limit in an infinite system: interactions act as a singular perturbation on the localized state with no interactions. The significance for proposed atomic experiments is that local measurements will show a large but nonthermal entropy in the many-body localized state.

This approach allows one to explore the physics around the MBL transition in systems much larger than those accessible to exact diagonalization. System sizes and length scales that can be controllably accessed by the MPS approach are comparable to those studied in state-of-the-art experiments. Results for 1D, quasi-1D, and 2D random systems, as well as 1D quasi-periodic systems are presented. On time scales explored (up to t≈300 in units set by the hopping amplitude), a slow, subdiffusive transport in a rather broad disorder range on the ergodic side of the MBL transition is found. For 1D random spin chains, which serve as a “standard model” of the MBL transition, the MPS study demonstrates a substantial drift of the critical point Wc(L) with the system size L: while for L≈20 we find Wc≈4, as also given by exact diagonalization, the MPS results for L=50–100 provide evidence that the critical disorder saturates, in the large-L limit, at Wc≈5.5. For quasi-periodic systems, these finite-size effects are much weaker, which suggests that they can be largely attributed to rare events. For quasi-1D (d×L, with d≪L) and 2D (L×L) random systems, the MPS data demonstrate an unbounded growth of Wc in the limit of large d and L, in agreement with analytical predictions based on the rare-event avalanche theory.},

	abstract = {Quantum phase transitions are studied in the nonchiral 𝑝-clock chain, and a new explicitly U(1)-symmetric clock model, by monitoring the ground-state fidelity susceptibility. For 𝑝≥5, the self-dual ℤ𝑝-symmetric chain displays a double-hump structure in the fidelity susceptibility with both peak positions and heights scaling logarithmically to their corresponding thermodynamic values. This scaling is precisely as expected for two Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions located symmetrically about the self-dual point, and so confirms numerically the theoretical scenario that sets 𝑝=5 as the lowest 𝑝 supporting BKT transitions in ℤ𝑝-symmetric clock models. For our U(1)-symmetric, non-self-dual minimal modification of the 𝑝-clock model we find that the phase diagram depends strongly on the parity of 𝑝 and only one BKT transition survives for 𝑝≥5. Using asymptotic calculus we map the self-dual clock model exactly, in the large 𝑝 limit, to the quantum 𝑂⁡(2) rotor chain. Finally, using bond-algebraic dualities we estimate the critical BKT transition temperatures of the classical planar 𝑝-clock models defined on square lattices, in the limit of extreme spatial anisotropy. Our values agree remarkably well with those determined via classical Monte Carlo for isotropic lattices. This work highlights the power of the fidelity susceptibility as a tool for diagnosing the BKT transitions even when only discrete symmetries are present.},

We consider tensor networks made of tensors that are invariant (or covariant) under the symmetry, and explain how to decompose and manipulate such tensors in order to exploit their symmetry. In numerical calculations, the use of U(1)-symmetric tensors allows selection of a specific number of particles, ensures the exact preservation of particle number, and significantly reduces computational costs.

We discuss how to incorporate a global symmetry, given by a compact, completely reducible group 𝒢, in tensor network decompositions and algorithms. This is achieved by considering tensors that are invariant under the action of the group 𝒢. Each symmetric tensor decomposes into two types of tensors: degeneracy tensors, containing all the degrees of freedom, and structural tensors, which only depend on the symmetry group. In numerical calculations, the use of symmetric tensors ensures the preservation of the symmetry, allows selection of a specific symmetry sector, and significantly reduces computational costs. On the other hand, the resulting tensor network can be interpreted as a superposition of exponentially many spin networks. Spin networks are used extensively in loop quantum gravity, where they represent states of quantum geometry. Our work highlights their importance in the context of tensor network algorithms as well, thus setting the stage for cross-fertilization between these two areas of research.},

In this paper, we demonstrate the usage of TPUs for massively parallel classical simulations of quantum many-body dynamics on long time scales. We apply our methods to study the phenomenon of Floquet prethermalization, i.e., exponentially slow heating in quantum spin chains subject to high-frequency periodic driving. We simulate the dynamics of 𝐿=34 qubits for over 105 Floquet periods, corresponding to circuits with 4×106 nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates. The circuits simulated have no additional symmetries and represent a pure-state evolution in the full 2𝐿-dimensional Hilbert space. This is achieved by distributing the computation over 128 TPU cores. On that size TPU cluster, we find speed-ups in wall-clock run time of 230 times and 15 times when compared to reference CPU and single-graphics-processing-unit (GPU) simulations, respectively, for shorter-time 30-qubit simulations that can be handled by all three platforms. We study the computational cost of the simulations, as a function of both the number of qubits and the number of TPU cores used, up to our maximum capacity of 𝐿=40 qubits, which requires a “full pod” of 2048 TPU cores with tens of terabytes of memory in total. For these simulations, an eight-TPU-core machine is comparable to a single A100 GPU and thus the full TPU pod is comparable to a machine with hundreds of top-of-the-line GPUs. However, the TPU pod is more energy and cost efficient and readily accessible (via Google Cloud), unlike such large many-GPU configurations. We also study the accumulation of numerical error as a function of circuit depth in very deep circuits. Our work demonstrates that TPUs can offer significant advantages for state-of-the-art simulations of quantum many-body dynamics.},

By employing a small computational cluster containing 60 graphical processing units (GPUs), we compute exact amplitudes and probabilities of 2×106 correlated bitstrings with some entries fixed (which span a subspace of the output probability distribution) for the Sycamore circuit with 53 qubits and 20 cycles. The obtained results verify the Porter-Thomas distribution of the large and deep quantum circuits of Google, provide datasets and benchmarks for developing approximate simulation methods, and can be used for spoofing the linear cross entropy benchmark of quantum supremacy. Then we extend the proposed big-batch method to a full-amplitude simulation approach that is more efficient than the existing Schrödinger method on shallow circuits and the Schrödinger-Feynman method in general, enabling us to obtain the state vector of Google’s simplifiable circuit with 𝑛=43 qubits and 𝑚=14 cycles using only one GPU. We also manage to obtain the state vector for Google’s simplifiable circuits with 𝑛=50 qubits and 𝑚=14 cycles using a small GPU cluster, breaking the previous record on the number of qubits in full-amplitude simulations.

Second, for weak disorder there is a stable diffusive region that persists up to a critical disorder strength that depends on the XY anisotropy. Third, for disorder strengths above this critical value, energy transport becomes increasingly subdiffusive. Fourth, the many-body localization transition moves to significantly higher disorder strengths as the XY anisotropy is increased.

Many physically relevant models in one dimension are Bethe-ansatz integrable, including the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg (also called the spin-1/2 𝑋𝑋𝑍 chain) and the Fermi-Hubbard model. Nevertheless, practical computations of correlation functions and transport coefficients pose hard problems from both the conceptual and technical points of view. Only because of recent progress in the theory of integrable systems, on the one hand, and the development of numerical methods, on the other hand, has it become possible to compute their finite-temperature and nonequilibrium transport properties quantitatively. Owing to the discovery of a novel class of quasilocal conserved quantities, there is now a qualitative understanding of the origin of ballistic finite-temperature transport, and even diffusive or superdiffusive subleading corrections, in integrable lattice models. The current understanding of transport in one-dimensional lattice models, in particular, in the paradigmatic example of the spin-1/2 𝑋𝑋𝑍 and Fermi-Hubbard models, is reviewed, as well as state-of-the-art theoretical methods, including both analytical and computational approaches. Among other novel techniques, matrix-product-state-based simulation methods, dynamical typicality, and, in particular, generalized hydrodynamics are covered.

It is argued that even though the time evolution cannot be simulated efficiently due to fast entanglement growth, the steady states in and out of equilibrium can be typically accurately approximated, with the result that chains of length of the order of n≈100 spins are accessible. Our results are demonstrated by performing explicit simulations of steady states and calculations of energy/spin densities/currents in several problems of heat and spin transport in quantum spin chains. A previously conjectured relation between quantum chaos and normal transport is re-confirmed with high accuracy for much larger systems.},

	abstract = {The interplay of interactions and disorder in a quantum many body system may lead to the elusive phenomenon of many body localization (MBL). It has been observed under precisely controlled conditions in synthetic quantum many-body systems, but to detect it in actual quantum materials seems challenging. In this work, we present a path to synthesize real materials that show signatures of many body localization by mixing different species of materials in the laboratory. To provide evidence for the functioning of our approach, we perform a detailed tensor-network based numerical analysis to study the effects of various doping ratios of the constituting materials. Moreover, in order to provide guidance to experiments, we investigate different choices of actual candidate materials. To address the challenge of how to achieve stability under heating, we study the effect of the electron-phonon coupling, focusing on effectively one dimensional materials embedded in one, two and three dimensional lattices. We analyze how this coupling affects the MBL and provide an intuitive microscopic description of the interplay between the electronic degrees of freedom and the lattice vibrations. Our work provides a guideline for the necessary conditions on the properties of the ingredient materials and, as such, serves as a road map to experimentally synthesizing real quantum materials exhibiting signatures of MBL.},

Here, we utilize ultracold atoms to simulate the dynamics of 1D Heisenberg spin chains and observe fast, local spin decay controlled by the anisotropy. However, even for isotropic interactions, we observe dephasing due to a new effect: an effective magnetic field created by superexchange. If spatially uniform, it leads only to uniform spin precession and is, therefore, typically ignored. However, we show through experimental studies and extensive numerical simulations how this superexchange-generated field is relevant and leads to additional dephasing mechanisms over the exchange anisotropy: There is dephasing due to (i) inhomogeneity of the effective field from variations of lattice depth between chains; (ii) a twofold reduction of the field at the edges of finite chains; and (iii) fluctuations of the effective field due to the presence of mobile holes in the system. The latter is a new coupling mechanism between holes and magnons. All these dephasing mechanisms have not been observed before with ultracold atoms and illustrate basic properties of the underlying Hubbard model.},

These exotic properties, however, also render their experimental characterization challenging, and finding ways to diagnose quantum spin liquids is therefore a pertinent challenge. Here, we numerically compute the spectral function of a single hole doped into the half-filled Hubbard model on the triangular lattice using techniques based on matrix product states. At half-filling the system has been proposed to realize a chiral spin liquid at intermediate interaction strength, surrounded by a magnetically ordered phase at strong interactions and a superconducting/metallic phase at weak interactions. We find that the spectra of these phases exhibit distinct signatures. By developing appropriate parton mean-field descriptions, we gain insight into the relevant low-energy features. While the magnetic phase is characterized by a dressed hole moving through the ordered spin background, we find indications of spinon dynamics in the chiral spin liquid. Our results suggest that the hole spectral function, as measured by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, provides a useful tool to characterize quantum spin liquids.},

	abstract = {An ultimate goal of quantum computing is to perform calculations beyond the reach of any classical computer. It is therefore imperative that useful quantum computers be very difficult to simulate classically, otherwise classical computers could be used for the applications envisioned for the quantum ones. Perfect quantum computers are unarguably exponentially difficult to simulate: the classical resources required grow exponentially with the number of qubits 𝑁 or the depth 𝐷 of the circuit. This difficulty has triggered recent experiments on deep, random circuits that aim to demonstrate that quantum devices may already perform tasks beyond the reach of classical computing. These real quantum computing devices, however, suffer from many sources of decoherence and imprecision which limit the degree of entanglement that can actually be reached to a fraction of its theoretical maximum. They are characterized by an exponentially decaying fidelity ℱ∼(1−𝜀)𝑁⁢𝐷 with an error rate 𝜀 per operation as small as ≈1\% for current devices with several dozen qubits or even smaller for smaller devices. In this work, we provide new insight on the computing capabilities of real quantum computers by demonstrating that they can be simulated at a tiny fraction of the cost that would be needed for a perfect quantum computer. Our algorithms compress the representations of quantum wave functions using matrix product states, which are able to capture states with low to moderate entanglement very accurately. This compression introduces a finite error rate 𝜀 so that the algorithms closely mimic the behavior of real quantum computing devices. The computing time of our algorithm increases only linearly with 𝑁 and 𝐷 in sharp contrast with exact simulation algorithms. We illustrate our algorithms with simulations of random circuits for qubits connected in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. We find that 𝜀 can be decreased at a polynomial cost in computing power down to a minimum error 𝜀∞. Getting below 𝜀∞ requires computing resources that increase exponentially with 𝜀∞/𝜀. For a two-dimensional array of 𝑁=54 qubits and a circuit with control-𝑍 gates, error rates better than state-of-the-art devices can be obtained on a laptop in a few hours. For more complex gates such as a swap gate followed by a controlled rotation, the error rate increases by a factor 3 for similar computing time. Our results suggest that, despite the high fidelity reached by quantum devices, only a tiny fraction (∼10−8) of the system Hilbert space is actually being exploited.},

	abstract = {The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in solids with broken time-reversal symmetry, typically in a ferromagnetic phase, as a consequence of spin-orbit coupling. Experimental and theoretical studies of the AHE are reviewed, focusing on recent developments that have provided a more complete framework for understanding this subtle phenomenon and have, in many instances, replaced controversy by clarity. Synergy between experimental and theoretical works, both playing a crucial role, has been at the heart of these advances. On the theoretical front, the adoption of the Berry-phase concepts has established a link between the AHE and the topological nature of the Hall currents. On the experimental front, new experimental studies of the AHE in transition metals, transition-metal oxides, spinels, pyrochlores, and metallic dilute magnetic semiconductors have established systematic trends. These two developments, in concert with first-principles electronic structure calculations, strongly favor the dominance of an intrinsic Berry-phase-related AHE mechanism in metallic ferromagnets with moderate conductivity. The intrinsic AHE can be expressed in terms of the Berry-phase curvatures and it is therefore an intrinsic quantum-mechanical property of a perfect crystal. An extrinsic mechanism, skew scattering from disorder, tends to dominate the AHE in highly conductive ferromagnets. The full modern semiclassical treatment of the AHE is reviewed which incorporates an anomalous contribution to wave-packet group velocity due to momentum-space Berry curvatures and correctly combines the roles of intrinsic and extrinsic (skew-scattering and side-jump) scattering-related mechanisms. In addition, more rigorous quantum-mechanical treatments based on the Kubo and Keldysh formalisms are reviewed, taking into account multiband effects, and demonstrate the equivalence of all three linear response theories in the metallic regime. Building on results from recent experiment and theory, a tentative global view of the AHE is proposed which summarizes the roles played by intrinsic and extrinsic contributions in the disorder strength versus temperature plane. Finally outstanding issues and avenues for future investigation are discussed.},

We derive the Bethe equations via algebraic Bethe ansatz, solving in the process the Heisenberg XXX spin chain. We discuss this famous spin chain model in some detail, covering in particular the coordinate Bethe ansatz, some properties of Bethe states, and the classical scaling limit leading to finite-gap equations. Then we proceed to the more involved SU(3) chiral Gross–Neveu model and derive the Bethe equations using nested algebraic Bethe ansatz to solve the arising SU(3) spin chain.

	abstract = {We examine the condensation and confinement mechanisms exhibited by a deformed toric code model proposed in [Castelnovo and Chamon, Phys. Rev. B, 2008]. The model describes both sides of a phase transition from a topological phase to a trivial phase. Our findings reveal an unconventional confinement mechanism that governs the behavior of the toric code excitations within the trivial phase. Specifically, the confined magnetic charge can still be displaced without any energy cost, albeit only via the application of non-unitary operators that reduce the norm of the state. This peculiar phenomenon can be attributed to a previously known feature of the model: it maintains the non-trivial ground state degeneracy of the toric code throughout the transition. We describe how this degeneracy arises in both phases in terms of spontaneous symmetry breaking of a generalized (1-form) symmetry and explain why such symmetry breaking is compatible with the trivial phase. The present study implies the existence of subtle considerations that must be addressed in the context of recently posited connections between topological phases and broken higher-form symmetries.},

We develop a model of the crossover in short 1D chains in which the MBL phase is destabilised by the formation of many-body resonances. The model reproduces several properties of the numerically observed crossover, including an apparent correlation length exponent ν = 1, exponential growth of the Thouless time with disorder strength, linear drift of the critical disorder strength with system size, scale-free resonances, apparent 1/ω dependence of disorder-averaged spectral functions , and sub-thermal entanglement entropy of small subsystems. In the crossover, resonances induced by a local perturbation are rare at numerically accessible system sizes L which are smaller than a resonance length λ. For L λ (in lattice units), resonances typically overlap, and this model does not describe the asymptotic transition. The model further reproduces controversial numerical observations which Refs. [1, 2] claimed to be inconsistent with MBL. We thus argue that the numerics to date is consistent with a MBL phase in the thermodynamic limit.},

We use the time-dependent variational principle as applied to matrix product states, which allows us to controllably study chains of a length up to L=100 spins, i.e., much larger than L≃20 that can be treated via exact diagonalization. For the analysis of the data, three complementary approaches are used: (i) determination of the exponent β which characterizes the power-law decay of the antiferromagnetic imbalance with time; (ii) similar determination of the exponent βΛ which characterizes the decay of a Schmidt gap in the entanglement spectrum; and (iii) machine learning with the use, as an input, of the time dependence of the spin densities in the whole chain. We find that the consideration of the larger system sizes substantially increases the estimate for the critical disorder Wc that separates the ergodic and many-body localized regimes, compared to the values of Wc in the literature. On the ergodic side of the transition, there is a broad interval of the strength of disorder with slow subdiffusive transport. In this regime, the exponents β and βΛ increase, with increasing L, for relatively small L but saturate for L≃50, indicating that these slow power laws survive in the thermodynamic limit. From a technical perspective, we develop an adaptation of the "learning by confusion" machine-learning approach that can determine Wc.},

	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevB.94.161109},
	abstract = {Motivated by a recent optical-lattice experiment by Choi et al. [Science 352, 1547 (2016)], we discuss how domain-wall melting can be used to investigate many-body localization. First, by considering noninteracting fermion models, we demonstrate that experimentally accessible measures are sensitive to localization and can thus be used to detect the delocalization-localization transition, including divergences of characteristic length scales. Second, using extensive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulations, we study fermions with repulsive interactions on a chain and a two-leg ladder. The extracted critical disorder strengths agree well with the ones found in existing literature. Introduction. In pioneering works based on perturbation theory [1,2], it was shown that Anderson localization, i.e., perfectly insulating behavior even at finite temperatures, can persist in the presence of interactions. Subsequent theoretical studies on mostly one-dimensional (1D) model systems have unveiled many fascinating properties of such a many-body localized (MBL) phase. The MBL phase is a dynamical phase of matter defined in terms of the properties of highly excited many-body eigenstates. It is characterized by an area-law entanglement scaling in all eigenstates [3-5], a logarithmic increase of entanglement in global quantum quenches [6-8], failure of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis [9] and therefore, memory of initial conditions [10,11]. The phe-nomenology of MBL systems is connected to the existence of a complete set of commuting (quasi) local integrals of motion (so-called "l-bits") that are believed to exist in systems in which all many-body eigenstates are localized [8,12,13]. These l-bits can be thought of as quasiparticles with an infinite lifetime, in close analogy to a zero-temperature Fermi liquid [1,14]. Important open questions pertain to the nature of the MBL transition and the existence of an MBL phase in higher dimensions, for which there are only few results (see, e.g., [15,16]), mainly due to the fact that numerical simulations are extremely challenging in dimensions higher than one for the MBL problem. The phenomenology of the MBL phase has mostly been established for closed quantum systems. A sufficiently strong coupling of a disordered, interacting system to a bath is expected to lead to thermalization (see, e.g., [17,18]). Thus, the most promising candidate systems for the experimental investigation of MBL physics are quantum simulators such as ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices or ion traps. So far, the cleanest evidence for MBL in an experiment has been reported for an interacting Fermi gas in an optical lattice with quasiperiodicity, realizing the Aubry-André model [19,20]. Other quantum gas experiments used the same quasiperiodic lattices or laser speckles to investigate Anderson localization [21,22] and the effect of interactions [23], however, at low energy densities. Experiments with ion traps provide an},

	title = {Interaction-enhanced many body localization in a generalized {Aubry}-{Andre} model},
	abstract = {We study the many-body localization (MBL) transition in a generalized Aubry-Andre model (also known as the GPD model) introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 146601 (2015) (Ref. [1]). In contrast to MBL in other disordered or quasiperiodic models, interaction seems to unexpectedly enhance MBL in the GPD model in some parameter range. To understand this counter-intuitive result, we demonstrate that the highest-energy single-particle band in the GPD model is unstable against even infinitesimal disorder, which leads to this surprising MBL phenomenon in the interacting model. We develop a mean-field theory description to understand the coupling between extended and localized states, which we validate using extensive exact diagonalization and DMRG-X numerical results. Introduction.-Interacting many-body systems should manifest eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) with long-time thermalization as the system becomes ergodic [2-4]. ETH, however, seems to fail generically in disordered or quasiperiodic 1D systems, at least for finite-size systems, although the situation is unclear in the thermodynamic limit. Such a phenomenon is known as many-body localization (MBL) [5-7]. MBL has been numerically and experimentally verified in numerous 1D disordered and quasiperiodic interacting systems with the generic finding that the interacting system undergoes an MBL transition at large disorder for a fixed interaction strength. In general, the disorder strength necessary for inducing MBL is much larger in the interacting system (and increases with increasing interaction) than in the corresponding noninteracting system. For example, the noninteracting 1D Anderson model is localized for any finite disorder whereas the corresponding interacting Anderson model undergoes MBL for large disorder [8]. This is expected as interaction tends to thermalize the system by sharing energy and information among the constituents, leading to ergodicity as postulated in ETH (all noninteracting systems are trivially nonergodic whereas the nonergodicity in MBL is nontrivial violating ETH). Another example is the well-known Aubry-Andre (AA) quasiperiodic model which has all states localized or extended for a critical "disorder" (i.e., quasiperiodic potential strength) larger or smaller than 1 for the noninteracting model [using convention in Eq. (2) below], whereas the corresponding interacting model exhibits MBL for disorder larger than 1.7 [9-12].},

Here we summarize and expand on our previous results for various entanglement measures such as the number and the Hartley number entropy. We investigate, in particular, possible alternative interpretations of our numerical data. We find that none of these alternative interpretations appear to hold and, in the process, discover further strong evidence for the absence of localization. Furthermore, we obtain more insights into the entanglement dynamics and the particle fluctuations by comparing with non-interacting systems where we derive several strict bounds. We find that renormalized versions of these bounds also hold in the interacting case where they provide support for numerically discovered scaling relations between number and entanglement entropies.},

	abstract = {Many-body localized (MBL) systems fail to reach thermal equilibrium under their own dynamics, even though they are interacting, nonintegrable, and in an extensively excited state. One instability towards thermalization of MBL systems is the so-called “avalanche”, where a locally thermalizing rare region is able to spread thermalization through the full system. The spreading of the avalanche may be modeled and numerically studied in finite one-dimensional MBL systems by weakly coupling an infinite-temperature bath to one end of the system. We find that the avalanche spreads primarily via strong many-body resonances between rare near-resonant eigenstates of the closed system. Thus we find and explore a detailed connection between many-body resonances and avalanches in MBL systems.},

	title = {The internal clock of many-body (de-)localization},
	abstract = {After a decade of many claims to the opposite, there now is a growing consensus that generic disordered quantum wires, e.g. the XXZ-Heisenberg chain, do not exhibit many-body localization (MBL)-at least not in a strict sense within a reasonable window of disorder values W. Specifically, computational studies of short wires exhibit an extremely slow but unmistakable flow of physical observables with increasing time and system size ("creep") that is consistently directed away from (strict) localization. Our work sheds fresh light on delocalization physics: Strong sample-to-sample fluctuations indicate the absence of a generic time scale, i.e. of a naive "clock rate"; however, the concept of an "internal clock" survives, at least in an ensemble sense. Specifically, we investigate the relaxation of the imbalance I(t) and its temporal fluctuations F(t), the entanglement and Renyi entropies, Se(t) and S2(t), in a 1D system of interacting disordered fermions. We observe that adopting Se(t), S2(t) as a measure for the internal time per sample reduces the sample-to-sample fluctuations but does not eliminate them. However, a (nearly) perfect collapse of the average I(t) and F(t) for different W is obtained when plotted against Se(t) or S2(t), indicating that the average entropy appropriately models the ensemble-averaged internal clock. We take the tendency for faster-than-logarithmic growth of Se(t) together with smooth dependency on W of all our observables within the entire simulation window as support for the cross-over scenario, discouraging an MBL transition within the traditional parametric window of computational studies.},

	abstract = {Thermalizing quantum systems are conventionally described by statistical mechanics at equilibrium. However, not all systems fall into this category, with many body localization providing a generic mechanism for thermalization to fail in strongly disordered systems. Many-body localized (MBL) systems remain perfect insulators at non-zero temperature, which do not thermalize and therefore cannot be described using statistical mechanics. In this Colloquium we review recent theoretical and experimental advances in studies of MBL systems, focusing on the new perspective provided by entanglement and non-equilibrium experimental probes such as quantum quenches. Theoretically, MBL systems exhibit a new kind of robust integrability: an extensive set of quasi-local integrals of motion emerges, which provides an intuitive explanation of the breakdown of thermalization. A description based on quasi-local integrals of motion is used to predict dynamical properties of MBL systems, such as the spreading of quantum entanglement, the behavior of local observables, and the response to external dissipative processes. Furthermore, MBL systems can exhibit eigenstate transitions and quantum orders forbidden in thermodynamic equilibrium. We outline the current theoretical understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition between many-body localized and ergodic phases, and anomalous transport in the vicinity of that transition. Experimentally, synthetic quantum systems, which are well-isolated from an external thermal reservoir, provide natural platforms for realizing the MBL phase. We review recent experiments with ultracold atoms, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, and quantum materials, in which different signatures of many-body localization have been observed. We conclude by listing outstanding challenges and promising future research directions.},

In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of ideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, we present a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and some of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of energy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables. Building on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an external bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from studies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench as a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results of numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic thermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems, and the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum chaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian eigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles. We then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal energy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review, we briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We introduce the concept of the generalized Gibbs ensemble, and discuss its connection with ideas of prethermalization in weakly interacting systems.},

	abstract = {Lattice models, also known as generalized Ising models or cluster expansions, are widely used in many areas of science and are routinely applied to the study of alloy thermodynamics, solid-solid phase transitions, magnetic and thermal properties of solids, fluid mechanics, and others. However, the problem of finding and proving the global ground state of a lattice model, which is essential for all of the aforementioned applications, has remained unresolved for relatively complex practical systems, with only a limited number of results for highly simplified systems known. In this paper, we present a practical and general algorithm that provides a provable periodically constrained ground state of a complex lattice model up to a given unit cell size and in many cases is able to prove global optimality over all other choices of unit cell. We transform the infinite-discrete-optimization problem into a pair of combinatorial optimization (MAX-SAT) and nonsmooth convex optimization (MAX-MIN) problems, which provide upper and lower bounds on the ground state energy, respectively. By systematically converging these bounds to each other, we may find and prove the exact ground state of realistic Hamiltonians whose exact solutions are difficult, if not impossible, to obtain via traditional methods. Considering that currently such practical Hamiltonians are solved using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms that are often unable to find the true global energy minimum and inherently cannot prove the optimality of their result, our paper opens the door to resolving longstanding uncertainties in lattice models of physical phenomena. An implementation of the algorithm is available at https://github.com/dkitch/maxsat-ising.},

Starting in an ordered ground state, quenches below the dynamical critical point give rise to a ferromagnetic long-time steady state with the Loschmidt return rate exhibiting \{anomalous\} cusps even when the order parameter never crosses zero. Quenches above the dynamical critical point lead to a paramagnetic long-time steady state with the return rate exhibiting \{regular\} cusps connected to zero crossings of the order parameter. Additionally, our simulations indicate that quenching slightly above the dynamical critical point leads to a coexistence region where both anomalous and regular cusps appear in the return rate. Quenches from the disordered phase further confirm our main conclusions. Our work supports the recent finding that anomalous cusps arise only when local spin excitations are the energetically dominant quasiparticles. Our results are accessible in modern Rydberg experiments.},

	abstract = {Spin models are the prime example of simplified many-body Hamiltonians used to model complex, strongly correlated realworld materials1. However, despite the simplified character of such models, their dynamics often cannot be simulated exactly on classical computers when the number of particles exceeds a few tens. For this reason, quantum simulation2 of spin Hamiltonians using the tools of atomic and molecular physics has become a very active field over the past years, using ultracold atoms3 or molecules4 in optical lattices, or trapped ions5. All of these approaches have their own strengths and limitations. Here we report an alternative platform for the study of spin systems, using individual atoms trapped in tunable twodimensional arrays of optical microtraps with arbitrary geometries, where filling fractions range from 60 to 100 per cent. When excited to high-energy Rydberg D states, the atoms undergo strong interactions whose anisotropic character opens the way to simulating exotic matter6. We illustrate the versatility of our system by studying the dynamics of a quantum Ising-like spin-1/2 system in a transverse field with up to 30 spins, for a variety of geometries in one and two dimensions, and for a wide range of interaction strengths. For geometries where the anisotropy is expected to have small effects on the dynamics, we find excellent agreement with ab initio simulations of the spin-1/2 system, while for strongly anisotropic situations the multilevel structure of the D states has a measurable influence7,8. Our findings establish arrays of single Rydberg atoms as a versatile platform for the study of quantum magnetism.},

All of these exhibit a macroscopic degeneracy at (formula presented) in the absence of the transverse field, which enters as a singular perturbation. We analyze these systems with a combination of a variational method at weak fields, a perturbative Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach from large fields, as well as quantum Monte Carlo simulations utilizing a cluster algorithm. Our results include instances of quantum order arising from classical criticality (triangular lattice) or classical disorder (pentagonal and probably hexagonal) as well as notable instances of quantum disorder arising from classical disorder (kagomé). We also discuss the effect of finite temperature, as well as the interplay between longitudinal and transverse fields—in the kagomé problem the latter gives rise to a nontrivial phase diagram with bond-ordered and bond-critical phases in addition to the disordered phase. We also note connections to quantum-dimer models and thereby to the physics of Heisenberg antiferromagnets in short-ranged resonating valence-bond phases that have been invoked in discussions of high-temperature superconductivity. © 2001 The American Physical Society.},

The zero-temperature theory at the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point has a critical point related to the self-dual point of a class of ZN models in the N→ limit. Two phase transitions featuring a fixed line are shown to appear in the phase diagram, one at zero temperature and at the RK point and another one at finite temperature above the RK point. The latter will be shown to correspond to a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) phase transition, while the former will be governed by a KT-like universality class, i.e., sharing many features with a KT transition but actually corresponding to a different universality class. On the other hand, we show that at the RK point no phase transition happens at finite temperature. For the three-dimensional case we derive the corresponding dual gauge theory model at the RK point. We show in this case that at zero temperature a first-order phase transition occurs, while at finite temperatures both first- and second-order phase transitions are possible, depending on the relative values of the couplings involved. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

This state is consistent with the plaquette resonating-valence-bond state. The energy gap of this state vanishes as a power law of L. It exhibits columnar dimer order, but has disorder within the dimer columns. This state persists up to V/J¡1, and the system changes to a dimer liquid state only at V/J=1. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

Here we show that dynamical constraints can similarly lead to slow thermalization and metastability in translationally invariant quantum many-body systems. We illustrate this general idea by considering two simple models: (i) a one-dimensional quantum analogue to classical constrained lattice gases where excitation hopping is constrained by the state of neighboring sites, mimicking excluded-volume interactions of dense fluids; and (ii) fully packed quantum dimers on the square lattice. Both models have a Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point at which kinetic and potential energy constants are equal. To one side of the RK point, where kinetic energy dominates, thermalization is fast. To the other, where potential energy dominates, thermalization is slow, memory of initial conditions persists for long times, and separation of timescales leads to pronounced metastability before eventual thermalization. Furthermore, in analogy with what occurs in the relaxation of classical glasses, the slow-thermalization regime displays dynamical heterogeneity as manifested by spatially segregated growth of entanglement.},

We find that quenches from a columnar VBS are ergodic and both order parameters and spatial correlations quickly relax to their thermal equilibrium. By contrast, the staggered side of the first-order transition does not display thermalization on numerically accessible timescales.

At the so-called Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point a quantum dimer Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Markov generator of the dynamics of classical dimers. A less well understood fact is that away from the RK point the quantum-classical connection persists: in this case the Hamiltonian corresponds to a nonstochastic "tilted" operator that encodes the statistics of time-integrated observables of the classical stochastic problem. This implies a direct relation between the phase behavior of quantum dimers and properties of ensembles of stochastic trajectories of classical dimers. We make these ideas concrete by studying fully packed dimers on the square lattice. Using transition path sampling - supplemented by trajectory umbrella sampling - we obtain the large deviation statistics of dynamical activity in the classical problem, and show the correspondence between the phase behavior of the classical and quantum systems. The transition at the RK point between quantum phases of distinct order corresponds, in the classical case, to a trajectory phase transition between active and inactive dynamical phases. Furthermore, from the structure of stochastic trajectories in the active dynamical phase we infer that the ground state of quantum dimers has columnar order to one side of the RK point. We discuss how these results relate to those from quantum Monte Carlo, and how our approach may generalize to other problems.},

We investigate their physics and study their suitability as an ansatz for the HAFM, as compared to a conventional RVB state which is in the toric-code Z2 topological phase. In particular, we find that a suitably optimized "semionic simplex RVB" outperforms the equally optimized conventional "simplex RVB" state, and that the entanglement spectrum (ES) of the semionic RVB behaves very differently from the ES of the conventional RVB, which suggests using the ES to discriminate the two phases.

In particular, we study the SU(4) antiferromagnetic "Heisenberg" model on the triangular lattice, both in the classical limit and in the quantum regime. Carrying out a numerical study using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we argue that the ground state is non-magnetic. We then derive a dimer expansion of the SU(4) spin model. An exact diagonalization (ED) study of the effective dimer model suggests that the ground state breaks translation invariance, forming a valence bond solid (VBS) with a 12-site unit cell. Finally, we consider the effect of SU(4)-symmetry breaking interactions due to Hund's coupling, and argue for a possible phase transition between a VBS and a magnetically ordered state.},

We further investigate the nature of this ordered phase, for which a 12-site unit cell has been previously proposed, with the surprising result that significant Bragg peaks are only present at two of the three high-symmetry points consistent with this unit cell. We attribute the absence of a detectable peak to its small magnitude due to the nearly uniform internal structure of the 12-site crystal cell. © 2006 The American Physical Society.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2404.16083},
	abstract = {Adaptive quantum circuits, which combine local unitary gates, midcircuit measurements, and feedforward operations, have recently emerged as a promising avenue for efficient state preparation, particularly on near-term quantum devices limited to shallow-depth circuits. Matrix product states (MPS) comprise a significant class of many-body entangled states, efficiently describing the ground states of one-dimensional gapped local Hamiltonians and finding applications in a number of recent quantum algorithms. Recently, it was shown that the AKLT state -- a paradigmatic example of an MPS -- can be exactly prepared with an adaptive quantum circuit of constant-depth, an impossible feat with local unitary gates due to its nonzero correlation length [Smith et al., PRX Quantum 4, 020315 (2023)]. In this work, we broaden the scope of this approach and demonstrate that a diverse class of MPS can be exactly prepared using constant-depth adaptive quantum circuits, outperforming optimal preparation protocols that rely on unitary circuits alone. We show that this class includes short- and long-ranged entangled MPS, symmetry-protected topological (SPT) and symmetry-broken states, MPS with finite Abelian, non-Abelian, and continuous symmetries, resource states for MBQC, and families of states with tunable correlation length. Moreover, we illustrate the utility of our framework for designing constant-depth sampling protocols, such as for random MPS or for generating MPS in a particular SPT phase. We present sufficient conditions for particular MPS to be preparable in constant time, with global on-site symmetry playing a pivotal role. Altogether, this work demonstrates the immense promise of adaptive quantum circuits for efficiently preparing many-body entangled states and provides explicit algorithms that outperform known protocols to prepare an essential class of states.},

	abstract = {Hybrid quantum-classical optimization and learning strategies are among the most promising approaches to harnessing quantum information or gaining a quantum advantage over classical methods. However, efficient estimation of the gradient of the objective function in such models remains a challenge due to several factors including the exponential dimensionality of the Hilbert spaces, and information loss of quantum measurements. In this work, we study generic parameterized circuits in the context of variational methods. We develop a framework for gradient estimation that exploits the algebraic symmetries of Hamiltonian characterized through Lie algebra or group theory. Particularly, we prove that when the dimension of the dynamical Lie algebra is polynomial in the number of qubits, one can estimate the gradient with polynomial classical and quantum resources. This is done by a series of Hadamard tests applied to the output of the ansatz with no change to its circuit. We show that this approach can be equipped with classical shadow tomography to further reduce the measurement shot complexity to scale logarithmically with the number of parameters.},

This study introduces an innovative distribution-aware Quantum-Classical-Quantum (QCQ) architecture, which integrates cutting-edge quantum software framework works with high-performance classical computing resources to address challenges in quantum simulation for materials and condensed matter physics. At the heart of this architecture is the seamless integration of VQE algorithms running on QPUs for efficient quantum state preparation, Tensor Network states, and QCNNs for classifying quantum states on classical hardware. For benchmarking quantum simulators, the QCQ architecture utilizes the cuQuantum SDK to leverage multi-GPU acceleration, integrated with PennyLane's Lightning plugin, demonstrating up to tenfold increases in computational speed for complex phase transition classification tasks compared to traditional CPU-based methods. This significant acceleration enables models such as the transverse field Ising and XXZ systems to accurately predict phase transitions with a 99.5\% accuracy. The architecture's ability to distribute computation between QPUs and classical resources addresses critical bottlenecks in Quantum-HPC, paving the way for scalable quantum simulation. The QCQ framework embodies a synergistic combination of quantum algorithms, machine learning, and Quantum-HPC capabilities, enhancing its potential to provide transformative insights into the behavior of quantum systems across different scales. As quantum hardware continues to improve, this hybrid distribution-aware framework will play a crucial role in realizing the full potential of quantum computing by seamlessly integrating distributed quantum resources with the state-of-the-art classical computing infrastructure.},

	abstract = {In the era of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the efficient preparation of many-body resource states is a task of paramount importance. In this paper we focus on the deterministic preparation of matrix-product states (MPS) in constant depth by utilizing measurements and classical communication to fuse smaller states into larger ones. We place strong constraints on the MPS that can be prepared using this method, which we refer to as MPS fusion. Namely, we establish that it is necessary for the MPS to have a flat entanglement spectrum. Using the recently introduced split-index MPS (SIMPS) representation, we then introduce a family of states that belong to interesting phases of matter protected by non-onsite symmetries and serve as resources for long-range quantum teleportation, but which lie beyond the scope of ordinary MPS fusion. It is shown constructively that these states can be prepared in constant depth using a broader class of measurement-assisted protocols, which we dub SIMPS fusion. Even in cases when MPS fusion is possible, using SIMPS fusion can give rise to significantly reduced resource overhead. Our results therefore simultaneously establish the boundaries of conventional MPS fusion and push the envelope of which states can be prepared using measurement-assisted protocols.},

These gradient issues can significantly undermine the trainability of VQC. In this work, we propose a strategy that regularizes model parameters with prior knowledge of the train data and Gaussian noise diffusion.

However, recent works have shown that classical machine learning algorithms are able to predict numerous properties of quantum systems with classical data. Despite various examples of learning tasks with provable quantum advantages being proposed, they all involve cryptographic functions and do not represent any physical scenarios encountered in laboratory settings. In this paper we prove quantum advantages for the physically relevant task of learning quantum observables from classical (measured out) data. We consider two types of observables: first we prove a learning advantage for linear combinations of Pauli strings, then we extend the result for the broader case of unitarily parametrized observables. For each type of observable we delineate the boundaries that separate physically relevant tasks which classical computers can solve using data from quantum measurements, from those where a quantum computer is still necessary for data analysis. Our results shed light on the utility of quantum computers for machine learning problems in the domain of quantum many body physics, thereby suggesting new directions where quantum learning improvements may emerge.},

Due to the significant impact of BPs on trainability, researchers have dedicated considerable effort to develop theoretical and heuristic methods to understand and mitigate their effects. As a result, the study of BPs has become a thriving area of research, influencing and cross-fertilizing other fields such as quantum optimal control, tensor networks, and learning theory.

While state vector simulations become infeasible for qubit counts over 50, our evaluation demonstrates that cuTensorNet speeds up simulations to be completed within seconds on the NVIDIA A100 GPU, even for qubit counts approaching 784. By employing multi-GPU processing with Message Passing Interface (MPI), we document a marked decrease in computation times, effectively demonstrating the strong linear speedup of our approach for increasing data sizes. This enables QSVMs to operate efficiently on High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, thereby opening a new window for researchers to explore complex quantum algorithms that have not yet been investigated. In accuracy assessments, our QSVM achieves up to 95{\textbackslash}\% on challenging classifications within the MNIST dataset for training sets larger than 100 instances, surpassing the capabilities of classical SVMs. These advancements position cuTensorNet within the cuQuantum SDK as a pivotal tool for scaling quantum machine learning simulations and potentially signpost the seamless integration of such computational strategies as pivotal within the Quantum-HPC ecosystem.},

Meanwhile, the existing practical construction of this MPO, based on the compression of a quantum circuit, is not as efficient as possible.

This construction can speed up the application of the QFT and the DFT, respectively, in quantum circuit simulations and QTT applications.

	abstract = {This is the documentation for the tensor library QSpace (v4.0), a toolbox to exploit `quantum symmetry spaces' in tensor network states in the quantum many-body context. QSpace permits arbitrary combinations of symmetries including the abelian symmetries \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_n\$ and \$U(1)\$, as well as all non-abelian symmetries based on the semisimple classical Lie algebras: \$A\_n\$, \$B\_n\$, \$C\_n\$, and \$D\_n\$, or respectively, the special unitary group SU(\$n\$), the odd orthogonal group SO(\$2n+1\$), the symplectic group Sp(\$2n\$), and the even orthogonal group SO(\$2n\$). The code (C++ embedded via the MEX interface into Matlab) is available open source as of QSpace v4.0 at https://bitbucket.org/qspace4u/ under the Apache 2.0 license. QSpace is designed as a bottom-up approach for non-abelian symmetries. It starts from the defining representation and the respective Lie algebra. By explicitly computing and tabulating generalized Clebsch-Gordan coefficient tensors, QSpace is versatile in the type of operations that it can perform across all symmetries. At the level of an application, much of the symmetry-related details are hidden within the QSpace C++ core libraries. Hence when developing tensor network algorithms with QSpace, these can be coded (nearly) as if there are no symmetries at all, despite being able to fully exploit general non-abelian symmetries.},

In this paper, we investigate the impact of gauge degrees of freedom in the virtual indices of the tensor network on the contraction process, specifically focusing on boundary matrix product state methods for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks. We show that the gauge transformation can affect the entanglement structures of the eigenstates of the transfer matrix and change how the physical information is encoded in the eigenstates, which can influence the accuracy of the numerical simulation. We demonstrate this effect by looking at two different examples. First, we focus on the local gauge transformation, and analyze its effect by viewing it as an imaginary-time evolution governed by a diagonal Hamiltonian. As a specific example, we perform a numerical analysis in the classical Ising model on the square lattice. Second, we go beyond the scope of local gauge transformations and study the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the triangular lattice. The partition function of this model has two tensor network representations connected by a non-local gauge transformation, resulting in distinct numerical performances in the boundary MPS calculation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01011},
	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a randomized QLP decomposition called Rand-QLP. Operating on a matrix A, Rand-QLP gives A = QLPT , where Q and P are orthonormal, and L is lower-triangular. Under the assumption that the rank of the input matrix is k, we derive several error bounds for Rand-QLP: bounds for the ﬁrst k approximate singular values and for the trailing block of the middle factor L, which show that the decomposition is rank-revealing; bounds for the distance between approximate subspaces and the exact ones for all four fundamental subspaces of a given matrix; and bounds for the errors of low-rank approximations constructed by the columns of Q and P. Rand-QLP is able to eﬀectively leverage modern computational architectures, due to the utilization of random sampling and the unpivoted QR decomposition, thus addressing a serious bottleneck associated with classical algorithms such as the singular value decomposition (SVD), column-pivoted QR (CPQR) and most recent matrix decomposition algorithms. To assess the performance behavior of diﬀerent algorithms, we use an Intel Xeon Gold 6240 CPU running at 2.6 GHz with a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPU. In comparison to CPQR and the SVD, Rand-QLP respectively achieves a speedup of up to 5 times and 6.6 times on the CPU and up to 3.8 times and 4.4 times with the hybrid GPU architecture. In terms of quality of approximation, our results on synthetic and real data show that the approximations by Rand-QLP are comparable to those of pivoted QLP and the optimal SVD, and in most cases are considerably better than those of CPQR.},

The convergence rate for singular values equals the square of the convergence rate for singular vectors. The convergence behaviour explains the occurrence of deflation in the interior of the matrix.We analyse the relationship between our algorithm and rank-revealing QR and URV decompositions. As a consequence, we obtain an algorithm for computing the URV decomposition, as well as a divide-and-conquer algorithm that computes singular values of dense matrices and may be beneficial on a parallel architecture. Our perturbation result for the smallest singular values of a triangular matrix is stronger than the traditional results because it guarantees high relative accuracy in the smallest singular values after an off -diagonal block of the matrix has been set to zero.},

	abstract = {The pivoted QLP decomposition is computed through two consecutive pivoted QR decompositions. It is an approximation to the computationally prohibitive singular value decomposition (SVD). This work is concerned with a partial QLP decomposition of matrices through the exploitation of random sampling. The method presented is tailored for low-rank matrices and called Randomized Unpivoted QLP (RU-QLP). Like pivoted QLP, RU-QLP is rank-revealing and yet it utilizes randomized column sampling and the unpivoted QR decomposition. The latter modifications allow RU-QLP to be highly scalable and parallelizable on advanced computational platforms. We provide an analysis for RU-QLP, thereby bringing insights into its characteristics and performance behavior. In particular, we derive bounds in terms of both spectral and Frobenius norms on: i) the rank-revealing property; ii) principal angles between approximate subspaces and exact singular subspaces and vectors; and iii) the errors of low-rank approximations. Effectiveness of the bounds is illustrated through numerical tests. We further use a modern, multicore machine equipped with a GPU to demonstrate the efficiency of RU-QLP. Our results show that compared to the randomized SVD, RU-QLP achieves a speedup of up to 7.1 and 8.5 times using the CPU and up to 2.3 and 5.8 times using the GPU for the decomposition of dense and sparse matrices, respectively.},

This study introduces an innovative distribution-aware Quantum-Classical-Quantum (QCQ) architecture , which integrates cutting-edge quantum software frameworks with high-performance classical computing resources to address challenges in quantum simulation for materials and condensed matter physics, including the prediction of quantum phase transitions. At the heart of this architecture is the seamless integration of Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms running on Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) for efficient quantum state preparation, Tensor Network states, and Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for classifying quantum states on classical hardware. For benchmarking quantum simulators, the QCQ architecture utilizes the cuQuantum SDK to leverage multi-GPU acceleration, integrated with PennyLane's Lightning plugin, demonstrating up to tenfold increases in computational speed for complex phase transition classification tasks compared to traditional CPU-based methods.

	title = {Quantum circuit learning on {NISQ} hardware},
	abstract = {Current quantum computers are small and error-prone systems for which the term noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) has become established. Since large scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers are not expected to be available in the near future, the task of finding NISQ suitable algorithms has received a lot of attention in recent years. The most prominent candidates in this context are variational quantum algorithms. Due to their hybrid quantum-classical architecture they require fewer qubits and quantum gates so that they can cope with the limitations of NISQ computers. An important class of variational quantum algorithms is the quantum circuit learning (QCL) framework. Consisting of a data encoding and a trainable, parametrized layer, these schemes implement a quantum model function that can be fitted to the problem at hand. For instance, in combination with the parameter shift rule to compute derivatives, they can be used to solve differential equations. QCL and related algorithms have been widely studied in the literature. However, numerical experiments are usually limited to simulators and results from real quantum computers are scarce. In this paper we close this gap by executing QCL circuits on a superconducting IBM quantum processor in conjunction with an analysis of the hardware errors. We show that exemplary QCL circuits with up to three qubits are executable on the IBM quantum computer. For this purpose, multiple functions are learned and an exemplary differential equation is solved on the quantum computer. Moreover, we present how the QCL framework can be used to learn Niclas Schillo: niclas.schillo@iao.fraunhofer.de Andreas Sturm: andreas.sturm@iao.fraunhofer.de different quantum model functions in parallel , which can be applied to solve coupled differential equations in an efficient way.},

	abstract = {A randomized algorithm for computing a data sparse representation of a given rank structured matrix A (a.k.a. an H-matrix) is presented. The algorithm draws on the randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD), and operates under the assumption that algorithms for rapidly applying A and A∗ to vectors are available. The algorithm analyzes the hierarchical tree that deﬁnes the rank structure using graph coloring algorithms to generate a set of random test vectors. The matrix is then applied to the test vectors, and in a ﬁnal step the matrix itself is reconstructed by the observed input-output pairs. The method presented is an evolution of the “peeling algorithm” of L. Lin, J. Lu, and L. Ying, “Fast construction of hierarchical matrix representation from matrix–vector multiplication,” JCP, 230(10), 2011. For the case of uniform trees, the new method substantially reduces the pre-factor of the original peeling algorithm. More signiﬁcantly, the new technique leads to dramatic acceleration for many non-uniform trees since it constructs sample vectors that are optimized for a given tree. The algorithm is particularly eﬀective for kernel matrices involving a set of points restricted to a lower dimensional object than the ambient space, such as a boundary integral equation deﬁned on a surface in three dimensions.},
