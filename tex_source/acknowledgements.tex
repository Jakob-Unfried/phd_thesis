First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Frank Pollmann, for your guidance and the countless lessons I learned from you over the years, from specific mechanisms in condensed matter physics, computational methods, and science communication to a healthy perspective on academia as a profession, and for embarking on the next journey with me.


I would also like to thank Johannes Hauschild for many discussions and for showing me the importance of accessibility, good documentation, and open-source culture.
